Introduction:

This project sees to find ways to increase profits using the internal micro-environment of the business. A data set of retail sales was taken from Kaggle.com to help facilitate this project.

Executive Summary:

In a summary, the beauty category from the data set seemed lacking in terms of revenues compared to its other counterparts. This was not the result of low sales or low customers (either due to season or other factors) rather a conclusion can be made it was due to the low revenue products sold. Which means the either the store layout changed resulting in more low revenue beauty products selling more or high earning revenue products were not very well advertised. This needs serious investigations as this is below average in terms of revenues per month for beauty categories.
Regardless, if we adjust the top 3 worst months to average revenues (£11,835) we can expect a total revenue of £151,709.00 resulting in a +6.82%. In conclusion, for the next step the store beauty layout will have to gain at least average revenue per month.
Below is a graph representing the effect.
 

Analysis: 

The problem was to increase profits within the internal micro-environment of the business hence it seemed easier to start with basic revenues, writing SQL queries lead to a simple revenue output grouped by its categories (Electronics, Clothing, Beauty) from these Beauty was lacking behind.
Another query was made that would give information about the revenues (divided monthly), total customers (divided monthly), total quantity bought (divided monthly), etc.
The output was opened into Excel for more further analysing to gain analytical average, variance insights.
The analysis basically tried to figure out whether customers stopped shopping in those months, but this was not the case as consumer numbers remained similar and not suffered any or no change. Hence a simple conclusion of layout or low product advertising or pushing can be made (internal issue). This was further concluded as the top 3 months which performed worst saw a variance of £-5,515.00 from the average expected revenue monthly (£11,835) to illustrate this a Tableau public dashboard was made.
In conclusion, various solutions such as layout options, advertising, quick promotions, etc can be made however this just has to be done to gain a decent average of £11,835 revenue per month and hence if successfully implemented we can see a +6.82% increase in profits.


Recommendations:

•	Change layout to enhance strong revenue selling beauty products.
•	Increase internal advertising of beauty products that have a higher profit margin%
•	Reduce low selling products quantity and increase higher selling quantities(experimental)
