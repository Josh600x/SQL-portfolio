Introduction

This project sees to find ways to increase profits via decreasing the countries and age groups with the highest exists and churn rate.

Executive Summary

In summary, Germany has seen the most increase in both churn rate (32.44%) and total exits from the company (814 out of 2,509) with majority of the exits coming from the 34-50 age range. This information suggests that customer relationships with the company within the geographical area seems to be low or of low efficiency. It is highly recommended that the head-office and the regional office work to see where the problem is and repair customer satisfaction with the regional branch either via advertising, surveys, discounts, etc.

Analysis 

The problem was to increase profits within the internal micro-environment of the business hence it seemed easier to start with writing SQL queries to a gain consumer knowledge such as total customers, tenure, age group analysis, churn rate percentage etc.
A subquery was also made to deal with churn rate percentage in SQL but was easily created in Tableau thanks to the create calculation field option. 
Majority of the analysis was done in tableau using geographical area as a basis for analysis and t was found that Germany had the highest churn rate and highest exits from the bank hence it was concluded that the company should focus on its retention outputs in Germany to increase profits and decrease exits.


Recommendations

•	Increase Advertising and Customer Retention Schemes
•	Add surveys into the mix to see where customers are truly unsatisfied with business.
•	Go through discounts or perks that separate it from the competitors if it is a competitor issue.
